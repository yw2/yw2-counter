This is an Android counter project. It increments counters when a certain button is pressed.

+: add one count

-: subtract one count

Reset: reset the counter to 0.

Create a new counter (on action bar): creates a new counter, and it will be saved to counter list.

Counter list (on action bar): view the counters and increment the count.
